Features:
Full stack:
FrontEnd:
React Native, Expo, Expo Router, Expo SDK 50,
Backend:
MongoDB Atlas, GraphQL, IBM Stepzen(scalable GraphQL), GraphQL API, API Ninjas(exercises), Custom MongoDB Database
Uses MongoDB to store hundreds of built in exercises with instructions
also stores our workouts and charts our progressSean with progress graphs
Exercise Database has search filter and view functionality
Logs our exercise sets while working out in da gym (react native=any platform, can use in browser because apples walled garden doesn't allow sideloading)
I like that we don't save data locally, have a database that we can access from any device and see progress
we can add features after tut, custom exercises, cardio log, step counter, plans, calorie/macros tracker, etc - need MVP to git a job and escape canada

npx create-expo-app@latest Workouts -t blank #will create an app in our current directory with latest expo
npm start #will run 'expo start', MetroBundler will give us a QR code, and Metro waiting on exp://192.168.2.16:8081
we can scan the code on Android or iOS to see our app, will need to download 'Expo Go' on iOS
Had troubles creating an account / signing into Expo Go,
npx expo install react-native-web react-dom @expo/metro-runtime #installs expos web dependancies, can run expo code in browser
Web is waiting on http://localhost:8081 #we can now write our code and debug in the browser, instead of using mobile device
We can also use simulators, iOS can only be used with XCode(iOS)
downloaded anbox, so we can test our mobile features on a simulator,
sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
sudo apt update
sudo apt install anbox #running these 3 commands will install anbox, a sim for ubuntu
Apparently, above doesn't work, need more:
https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/environment-setup?guide=native&platform=android#android-sdk
https://developer.android.com/studio
tar -xvf android-studio-2023.2.1.25-linux.tar.gz #installs executable downloaded from official site
cd android-studio/bin
./studio.sh #will open android studio installer, will need to add PATH, to fix below error
Failed to resolve the Android SDK path. Default install location not found: /home/sean/Android/sdk. Use ANDROID_HOME to set the Android SDK location.
Add the following lines to your $HOME/.bash_profile or $HOME/.bashrc (if you are using zsh then ~/.zprofile or ~/.zshrc) config file:
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
Go to HOME Press 'Ctrl+H' shows hidden files, add above change 'Sdk' to 'sdk' and it works, now need to set up a virtual phone to sim
Error: Can't find the device we installed pixel(something)
https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#developer-device-options
Fix: You need to first open the device in Android Studio, Then load it through expo/npm start, finally we can get to work.
Will need to download the expo go app on your virtual device before you can start debugging
Finally, we got our app to open on the simphone, only took 3?ish hours, better than flutter(3 days), time to work.
'r' press R to reload the app
'c' press C to clear the console
