Features:
Full stack:
FrontEnd:
React Native, Expo, Expo Router, Expo SDK 50,
Backend:
MongoDB Atlas, GraphQL, IBM Stepzen(scalable GraphQL), GraphQL API, API Ninjas(exercises), Custom MongoDB Database
Uses MongoDB to store hundreds of built in exercises with instructions
also stores our workouts and charts our progressSean with progress graphs
Exercise Database has search filter and view functionality
Logs our exercise sets while working out in da gym (react native=any platform, can use in browser because apples walled garden doesn't allow sideloading)
I like that we don't save data locally, have a database that we can access from any device and see progress
we can add features after tut, custom exercises, cardio log, step counter, plans, calorie/macros tracker, etc - need MVP to git a job and escape canada

npx create-expo-app@latest Workouts -t blank #will create an app in our current directory with latest expo
npm start #will run 'expo start', MetroBundler will give us a QR code, and Metro waiting on exp://192.168.2.16:8081
we can scan the code on Android or iOS to see our app, will need to download 'Expo Go' on iOS
Had troubles creating an account / signing into Expo Go,
npx expo install react-native-web react-dom @expo/metro-runtime #installs expos web dependancies, can run expo code in browser
Web is waiting on http://localhost:8081 #we can now write our code and debug in the browser, instead of using mobile device
